       "<br><br>29/10/2016<br><br>On Design Thinking: A Reflection On Reworking A Novel<br><br>A year ago I began working on a novel with the idea that all I needed was a cast of characters, a<br><br>world and a plot that went from A to B. I could not have been more wrong. Around three-fourths of<br><br>the way through the novel, I found myself writing without direction, caught in the nitty-gritties of<br><br>detail, worldbuilding and characters; unable to extract the story and push it in the direction that I<br><br>wanted it to go in. Towards the very end of the writing, the story had spiraled out of control, into<br><br>something that had too many motifs and themes to be truly thoughtful. It was directionless and<br><br>frequently contradictory – even incoherent, in places, with incomplete character arcs that ended in<br><br>the classic rookie writer’s problem: they simply disappeared off the map altogether.<br><br>This is, perhaps, an unorthodox example to pick for a design thinking project. But as I listened to the<br><br>lectures on design thinking, I was forcibly struck by the similarities between the description of the<br><br>process – what is, what if, what wows, what works – and the ways in which this process parallels the<br><br>creation of a novel. Early on in the lectures, Diaz picked apart the concept of the Moses<br><br>myth of creativity, i.e. that creativity resides purely in genius and is not something which can be<br><br>cultivated or organized. This was when I realized that all along I’d been treating the novel as a<br><br>mysterious entity which could only be produced through genius, rather than a project which could<br><br>be managed systematically – which, dare I say, could even be created by using design thinking<br><br>principles.<br><br>Selection &amp; Application<br><br>So I went back to the drawing board and decided to treat the novel as a project, rather than a<br><br>mysterious entity which would spring fully formed from my mind. I selected the Visualization tool<br><br>we’d explored over the five weeks for this and began to rebuild my novel from the ground up. The<br><br>visualization tool felt like the appropriate choice in that it is a useful way in which to place ideas<br><br>which are not necessarily easily verbalized on paper – which gives it a tangible presence that makes<br><br>it easier to discern unconscious and latent patterns, needs and desires that would not have been<br><br>immediately evident otherwise. The intangible nature of themes and motifs were best matched to<br><br>the visualization tool which enables the formulation of the intangible in a way that makes it easier to<br><br>grasp and think about. It was also an excellent way of escaping from the tendency to return to<br><br>outlines and other collected material – words, in other words – and to force me to take a step back<br><br>and think outside the box – outside my preconceived notions and ideas – when examining what I<br><br>wanted to do with my novel.<br><br>\n",

       "<br><br>29/10/2016<br><br>Rather than turn this process over to a group of people, however, I used the visualization tool in a<br><br>more personal and auto-ethnographical sense, to express the various concepts, themes and motifs –<br><br>occasionally even moments – I had been exploring in my novel. I did this by creating several collage-<br><br>cum-moodboard of images and fragments of thoughts, phrases and ideas that were both academic<br><br>and literary or poetical which I had been both unconsciously and consciously examining – which<br><br>struck a chord with me whenever I thought about my novel’s plot, various characters and themes. I<br><br>then laid it out and tried to trace the patterns and themes which emerged, to be more conscious of<br><br>what I had been working with and to see how they all fit together within the context of my novel.<br><br>Insights &amp; Approach<br><br>By thinking conceptually, rather than falling back on the standard formats of novel outlining, I began<br><br>to notice certain themes and ideas which were connecting characters who had existed very<br><br>separately on the page before. Where they once crossed each other without ever interacting or even<br><br>appearing linked except for the bare necessities of plot, I noticed certain ideas which kept cropping<br><br>up and recurring, visually framed, across these different characters. They weren’t necessarily similar<br><br>themes so much as motifs; symbolic elements which I had failed to be conscious of while writing,<br><br>which had led to the characters meandering all over the page without necessarily going anywhere.<br><br>As a tool, the visualization tool forced me to quite literally build from scratch – to stay away from<br><br>falling back on ‘safe’ and ‘known’ things like the plot outline and the lists and sheets I’d built up over<br><br>the last year – and by doing so, it formed a new framework of thinking about the novel. I had a<br><br>‘thesis statement’, now, for the piece: one unifying theme and question I could come back to when I<br><br>worked on the various elements of the story. It was being able to reframe these verbal ideas I’d had<br><br>and transferring them into another medium, one which was more conceptual – like a Rorschach, as<br><br>it was called in one of the video lectures – that made it easier to trace the more subconscious<br><br>connections – or the possible subconscious connections at play – and to unify them in patterns and<br><br>ideas that could form a thesis statement for my novel.<br><br>I’d used this tool a few times before when writing stories, but doing it in light of thinking of it as a<br><br>design thinking tool helped me to be a lot more conscious of the process and to treat this less as a<br><br>fun or relaxing activity and more as a learning experience. These images and fragments of concepts<br><br>weren’t just images but tools which could yield insights into my own unconscious desires and needs<br><br>while writing this novel – a way of understanding what I’d wanted to explore and how to be<br><br>conscious about it, instead of going about it vaguely as I did before.<br><br>\n",

       "<br><br>29/10/2016<br><br>On Design Thinking: A Reflection On Reworking A Novel<br><br>A year ago I began working on a novel with the idea that all I needed was a cast of characters, a<br><br>world and a plot that went from A to B. I could not have been more wrong. Around three-fourths of<br><br>the way through the novel, I found myself writing without direction, caught in the nitty-gritties of<br><br>detail, worldbuilding and characters; unable to extract the story and push it in the direction that I<br><br>wanted it to go in. Towards the very end of the writing, the story had spiraled out of control, into<br><br>something that had too many motifs and themes to be truly thoughtful. It was directionless and<br><br>frequently contradictory – even incoherent, in places, with incomplete character arcs that ended in<br><br>the classic rookie writer’s problem: they simply disappeared off the map altogether.<br><br>This is, perhaps, an unorthodox example to pick for a design thinking project. But as I listened to the<br><br>lectures on design thinking, I was forcibly struck by the similarities between the description of the<br><br>process – what is, what if, what wows, what works – and the ways in which this process parallels the<br><br>creation of a novel. Early on in the lectures, Diaz picked apart the concept of the Moses<br><br>myth of creativity, i.e. that creativity resides purely in genius and is not something which can be<br><br>cultivated or organized. This was when I realized that all along I’d been treating the novel as a<br><br>mysterious entity which could only be produced through genius, rather than a project which could<br><br>be managed systematically – which, dare I say, could even be created by using design thinking<br><br>principles.<br><br>Selection &amp; Application<br><br>So I went back to the drawing board and decided to treat the novel as a project, rather than a<br><br>mysterious entity which would spring fully formed from my mind. I selected the Visualization tool<br><br>we’d explored over the five weeks for this and began to rebuild my novel from the ground up. The<br><br>visualization tool felt like the appropriate choice in that it is a useful way in which to place ideas<br><br>which are not necessarily easily verbalized on paper – which gives it a tangible presence that makes<br><br>it easier to discern unconscious and latent patterns, needs and desires that would not have been<br><br>immediately evident otherwise. The intangible nature of themes and motifs were best matched to<br><br>the visualization tool which enables the formulation of the intangible in a way that makes it easier to<br><br>grasp and think about. It was also an excellent way of escaping from the tendency to return to<br><br>outlines and other collected material – words, in other words – and to force me to take a step back<br><br>and think outside the box – outside my preconceived notions and ideas – when examining what I<br><br>wanted to do with my novel.<br><br>\n",

These images and fragments of concepts<br><br>weren’t just images but tools which could yield insights into my own unconscious desires and needs<br><br>while writing this novel – a way of understanding what I’d wanted to explore and how to be<br><br>conscious about it, instead of going about it vaguely as I did before.<br><br>\n",

This was when I realized that all along I’d been treating the novel as a<br><br>mysterious entity which could only be produced through genius, rather than a project which could<br><br>be managed systematically – which, dare I say, could even be created by using design thinking<br><br>principles.<br><br>Selection &amp; Application<br><br>So I went back to the drawing board and decided to treat the novel as a project, rather than a<br><br>mysterious entity which would spring fully formed from my mind. I selected the Visualization tool<br><br>we’d explored over the five weeks for this and began to rebuild my novel from the ground up. The<br><br>visualization tool felt like the appropriate choice in that it is a useful way in which to place ideas<br><br>which are not necessarily easily verbalized on paper – which gives it a tangible presence that makes<br><br>it easier to discern unconscious and latent patterns, needs and desires that would not have been<br><br>immediately evident otherwise. The intangible nature of themes and motifs were best matched to<br><br>the visualization tool which enables the formulation of the intangible in a way that makes it easier to<br><br>grasp and think about. It was also an excellent way of escaping from the tendency to return to<br><br>outlines and other collected material – words, in other words – and to force me to take a step back<br><br>and think outside the box – outside my preconceived notions and ideas – when examining what I<br><br>wanted to do with my novel.<br><br>\n",

       "<br><br>29/10/2016<br><br>Rather than turn this process over to a group of people, however, I used the visualization tool in a<br><br>more personal and auto-ethnographical sense, to express the various concepts, themes and motifs –<br><br>occasionally even moments – I had been exploring in my novel. I did this by creating several collage-<br><br>cum-moodboard of images and fragments of thoughts, phrases and ideas that were both academic<br><br>and literary or poetical which I had been both unconsciously and consciously examining – which<br><br>struck a chord with me whenever I thought about my novel’s plot, various characters and themes. I<br><br>then laid it out and tried to trace the patterns and themes which emerged, to be more conscious of<br><br>what I had been working with and to see how they all fit together within the context of my novel.<br><br>Insights &amp; Approach<br><br>By thinking conceptually, rather than falling back on the standard formats of novel outlining, I began<br><br>to notice certain themes and ideas which were connecting characters who had existed very<br><br>separately on the page before. Where they once crossed each other without ever interacting or even<br><br>appearing linked except for the bare necessities of plot, I noticed certain ideas which kept cropping<br><br>up and recurring, visually framed, across these different characters. They weren’t necessarily similar<br><br>themes so much as motifs; symbolic elements which I had failed to be conscious of while writing,<br><br>which had led to the characters meandering all over the page without necessarily going anywhere.<br><br>As a tool, the visualization tool forced me to quite literally build from scratch – to stay away from<br><br>falling back on ‘safe’ and ‘known’ things like the plot outline and the lists and sheets I’d built up over<br><br>the last year – and by doing so, it formed a new framework of thinking about the novel. I had a<br><br>‘thesis statement’, now, for the piece: one unifying theme and question I could come back to when I<br><br>worked on the various elements of the story. It was being able to reframe these verbal ideas I’d had<br><br>and transferring them into another medium, one which was more conceptual – like a Rorschach, as<br><br>it was called in one of the video lectures – that made it easier to trace the more subconscious<br><br>connections – or the possible subconscious connections at play – and to unify them in patterns and<br><br>ideas that could form a thesis statement for my novel.<br><br>I’d used this tool a few times before when writing stories, but doing it in light of thinking of it as a<br><br>design thinking tool helped me to be a lot more conscious of the process and to treat this less as a<br><br>fun or relaxing activity and more as a learning experience. These images and fragments of concepts<br><br>weren’t just images but tools which could yield insights into my own unconscious desires and needs<br><br>while writing this novel – a way of understanding what I’d wanted to explore and how to be<br><br>conscious about it, instead of going about it vaguely as I did before.<br><br>\n",
