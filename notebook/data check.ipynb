      "Challenge||For some time I frequented a public gym and showered there before my work day.|Although the|showers may have been cleaned daily, they were not cleaned between each use - sometimes|the floor was, well “icky” and traditional flip-flops just didn’t cut it.|I searched and searched, for|an existing product that would provide the protection I needed, without any success.|I then|realized a need for a solution for increased sanitation when using any facility that has communal|showers - gyms, dorms, camps, athletic training facilities, etc.|I came up with an idea that would|provide antimicrobial protection for the feet while using these facilities’ showers.|The challenge|was how best to explain my idea, prove that there was a need, offer a solution, and propose it to|potential sponsors for development.||I spoke with fellow gym rats, college students, moms of summer campers, professional athletes,|etc. to see if they agreed that a product like mine could be helpful. Once I received excited|interest in my solution, I set about trying to find a way to make it a reality. My next step was to|submit a formal request for a design patent. Then, equipped with a list of businesses from my|target market, I would need to find the best way to get my idea out to the potential backers.|||Selection|||With limited funds, I had to focus on a method to share a prototype of my antimicrobial shower|shoe idea to determine interest, by potential stakeholders, in a product that was only a concept|at that point.|I thought of using some type of drawing that would depict what it would look like|and highlight the benefits, instead of a physical prototype. This is where the Visualization Tool|came into play.||As Angela Meyer stated in her Visualization video from Module 1, ​“When you get to concept|development visualization becomes incredibly key. Because concepts are literally coming out of your|imagination. And your brain is creating pictures of something that doesn't yet exist. It's creating|pictures of something that will soon be.”||She also stated that, “As we move forward into prototyping, we get much more detailed in the way|that we start to visualize. Then we create very complex diagrams, or maps of how we think the|customer experience ideally is going to work.”||I needed that complex diagram of something that wasn’t yet real.\n",
      "\n",
      "Application|||Since I already had a rough “to-scale” drawing submitted along with my request for a design|patent, I was able to provide enough details of the product idea to a professional that could|construct an electronic 3-D rendering in a video format. This way a link to the video could be|shared via email to each business on the list that I gathered for my target market.\n",
      "\n",
      "The video was built similar to an infomercial with the 3-D artistic technology making the concept|appear real, including a voice-over explaining the benefits of the product while highlighting|features of the design.

       "\"Reflection – Visualization   Deiby\\n\\nChallenge    For some time I frequented a public gym and showered there before my work day.  Although the  showers may have been cleaned daily, they were not cleaned between each use - sometimes  the floor was, well “icky” and traditional flip-flops just didn’t cut it.  I searched and searched, for  an existing product that would provide the protection I needed, without any success.  I then  realized a need for a solution for increased sanitation when using any facility that has communal  showers - gyms, dorms, camps, athletic training facilities, etc.  I came up with an idea that would  provide antimicrobial protection for the feet while using these facilities’ showers.  The challenge  was how best to explain my idea, prove that there was a need, offer a solution, and propose it to  potential sponsors for development.    I spoke with fellow gym rats, college students, moms of summer campers, professional athletes,  etc. to see if they agreed that a product like mine could be helpful. Once I received excited  interest in my solution, I set about trying to find a way to make it a reality. My next step was to  submit a formal request for a design patent. Then, equipped with a list of businesses from my  target market, I would need to find the best way to get my idea out to the potential backers.      Selection      With limited funds, I had to focus on a method to share a prototype of my antimicrobial shower  shoe idea to determine interest, by potential stakeholders, in a product that was only a concept  at that point.  I thought of using some type of drawing that would depict what it would look like  and highlight the benefits, instead of a physical prototype. This is where the Visualization Tool  came into play.    As Angela Meyer stated in her Visualization video from Module 1, \\u200b“When you get to concept  development visualization becomes incredibly key. Because concepts are literally coming out of your  imagination. And your brain is creating pictures of something that doesn't yet exist. It's creating  pictures of something that will soon be.”    She also stated that, “As we move forward into prototyping, we get much more detailed in the way  that we start to visualize. Then we create very complex diagrams, or maps of how we think the  customer experience ideally is going to work.”    I needed that complex diagram of something that wasn’t yet real.\\n\\nApplication      Since I already had a rough “to-scale” drawing submitted along with my request for a design  patent, I was able to provide enough details of the product idea to a professional that could  construct an electronic 3-D rendering in a video format. This way a link to the video could be  shared via email to each business on the list that I gathered for my target market.\\n\\nThe video was built similar to an infomercial with the 3-D artistic technology making the concept  appear real, including a voice-over explaining the benefits of the product while highlighting  features of the design. I believed this would be a good way for others to visualize my idea.  I  emailed this video link to those on my target list and was able to get feedback by receiving  callbacks from companies that wanted to discuss the idea further.

       "  vpi@mn.nl<br><br>Mind Mapping,      Challenge:     For several years I have been working for an Asset manager in the Netherlands. During this period I have been involved in many  projects. Certainly in the world of asset management, much has changed in recent years in the area of Law and Regulations.  What I mainly experience in these projects is that all departments have a different interest in starting a new project. This  certainly does not benefit the project. How do you get everyone to complete a project in the common interest and how do you  motivate everyone who participate in the project?    Selection:    An improvement project can be approached in different ways. The most common way is the scrum approach. We work in  multidisciplinary teams that work in short sprints, with a fixed length of 1 to 4 weeks. Cooperation is very important and  everyone must be able to respond quickly to changing circumstances. Scrum is based on the theory of empirical process  control, or empiricism. Empiricism assumes that knowledge arises from experience and making decisions based on what is  known.     I chose mind mapping because I am looking for a way to show the creativity colleagues always have at the start of a project,  to  keep this up to date and very important to keep it visible.   But also with the thoughts to keep colleagues motivated and to show how their creativity contributes to the project.    So I want to see if scrum can be combined with Design Thinking and especially with Mind mapping.    Application:    When starting a new project at work, I checked whether it is workable to combine the scrum approach with Mind Mapping. The  central theme was to increase the STP (Straight through processing) rate for a specific product that we trade with an x  percentage.    As a scrum team, we have tried to provide insight into the various topics related to the 'increase STP rate' via a paper diagram.  Each team member could indicate in this diagram his or her creativity which related to increasing the STP rate.    After this we went to see if there was a connection between certain ideas. We quickly learned that certain ideas could be  combined and that certain steps in the project could be skipped. By combining scrum work and mind mapping, we were able to  go live with implementation faster and increase STP speed step by step.    By making the project visible through a diagram, colleagues also indicated that this gave them more energy to participate in the  project.<br><br>D e s i g n  T h i n k i n g<br><br>Insight:    The insight I got to combine scrum with mind mapping (Design thinking) is that if you make everyone's creativity and thinking  visible through Mind mapping, you will come sooner to a solid solution to complete a project.

       " vpi@mn.nl | Mind Mapping, Challenge: For several years I have been working for an Asset manager in the Netherlands. During this period I have been involved in many projects. Certainly in the world of asset management, much has changed in recent years in the area of Law and Regulations. What I mainly experience in these projects is that all departments have a different interest in starting a new project. This certainly does not benefit the project. How do you get everyone to complete a project in the common interest and how do you motivate everyone who participate in the project? Selection: An improvement project can be approached in different ways. The most common way is the scrum approach. We work in multidisciplinary teams that work in short sprints, with a fixed length of 1 to 4 weeks. Cooperation is very important and everyone must be able to respond quickly to changing circumstances. Scrum is based on the theory of empirical process control, or empiricism. Empiricism assumes that knowledge arises from experience and making decisions based on what is known. I chose mind mapping because I am looking for a way to show the creativity colleagues always have at the start of a project, to keep this up to date and very important to keep it visible. But also with the thoughts to keep colleagues motivated and to show how their creativity contributes to the project. So I want to see if scrum can be combined with Design Thinking and especially with Mind mapping.
