      "Mind Mapping,      Challenge:     For several years I have been working for an Asset manager in the Netherlands. During this period I have been involved in many  projects. Certainly in the world of asset management, much has changed in recent years in the area of Law and Regulations.  What I mainly experience in these projects is that all departments have a different interest in starting a new project. This  certainly does not benefit the project. How do you get everyone to complete a project in the common interest and how do you  motivate everyone who participate in the project?    Selection:    An improvement project can be approached in different ways. The most common way is the scrum approach. We work in  multidisciplinary teams that work in short sprints, with a fixed length of 1 to 4 weeks. Cooperation is very important and  everyone must be able to respond quickly to changing circumstances. Scrum is based on the theory of empirical process  control, or empiricism. Empiricism assumes that knowledge arises from experience and making decisions based on what is  known.     I chose mind mapping because I am looking for a way to show the creativity colleagues always have at the start of a project,  to  keep this up to date and very important to keep it visible.   But also with the thoughts to keep colleagues motivated and to show how their creativity contributes to the project.    So I want to see if scrum can be combined with Design Thinking and especially with Mind mapping.    Application:    When starting a new project at work, I checked whether it is workable to combine the scrum approach with Mind Mapping. The  central theme was to increase the STP (Straight through processing) rate for a specific product that we trade with an x  percentage.    As a scrum team, we have tried to provide insight into the various topics related to the 'increase STP rate' via a paper diagram.  Each team member could indicate in this diagram his or her creativity which related to increasing the STP rate.    After this we went to see if there was a connection between certain ideas. We quickly learned that certain ideas could be  combined and that certain steps in the project could be skipped. By combining scrum work and mind mapping, we were able to  go live with implementation faster and increase STP speed step by step.    By making the project visible through a diagram, colleagues also indicated that this gave them more energy to participate in the  project.\n",

       "  vpi@mn.nl<br><br>Mind Mapping,      Challenge:     For several years I have been working for an Asset manager in the Netherlands. During this period I have been involved in many  projects. Certainly in the world of asset management, much has changed in recent years in the area of Law and Regulations.  What I mainly experience in these projects is that all departments have a different interest in starting a new project. This  certainly does not benefit the project. How do you get everyone to complete a project in the common interest and how do you  motivate everyone who participate in the project?    Selection:    An improvement project can be approached in different ways. The most common way is the scrum approach. We work in  multidisciplinary teams that work in short sprints, with a fixed length of 1 to 4 weeks. Cooperation is very important and  everyone must be able to respond quickly to changing circumstances. Scrum is based on the theory of empirical process  control, or empiricism. Empiricism assumes that knowledge arises from experience and making decisions based on what is  known.     I chose mind mapping because I am looking for a way to show the creativity colleagues always have at the start of a project,  to  keep this up to date and very important to keep it visible.   But also with the thoughts to keep colleagues motivated and to show how their creativity contributes to the project.    So I want to see if scrum can be combined with Design Thinking and especially with Mind mapping.    Application:    When starting a new project at work, I checked whether it is workable to combine the scrum approach with Mind Mapping. The  central theme was to increase the STP (Straight through processing) rate for a specific product that we trade with an x  percentage.    As a scrum team, we have tried to provide insight into the various topics related to the 'increase STP rate' via a paper diagram.  Each team member could indicate in this diagram his or her creativity which related to increasing the STP rate.    After this we went to see if there was a connection between certain ideas. We quickly learned that certain ideas could be  combined and that certain steps in the project could be skipped. By combining scrum work and mind mapping, we were able to  go live with implementation faster and increase STP speed step by step.    By making the project visible through a diagram, colleagues also indicated that this gave them more energy to participate in the  project.<br><br>D e s i g n  T h i n k i n g<br><br>Insight:    The insight I got to combine scrum with mind mapping (Design thinking) is that if you make everyone's creativity and thinking  visible through Mind mapping, you will come sooner to a solid solution to complete a project.
